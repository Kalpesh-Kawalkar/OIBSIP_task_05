## Sales Prediction using Python
### Description:
It is a dataset for linear regression. Consists of sales info for mainly three types of items TV, Newspaper and Radio.
### Approach:
Used VotingRegressor for the final predictions on sales.

A voting regressor is an ensemble meta-estimator that fits several base regressors, each on the whole dataset. Then it averages the individual predictions to form a final prediction.
### Models Used:
I used following models to build the VotingRegressor
1. LinearRegression
2. Decision Tree Regressor
3. Random Forest Regressor
4. Gradient Boosting Regressor
5. Extra Trees Regressor
6. Lasso Regression method
7. KNN Regressor
